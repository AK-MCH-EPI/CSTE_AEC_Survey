# CSTE_AEC_Survey
Survey using Rshiny to understand AEC competencies

This simple Rshiny survey is designed to understand the competency level and interest in the 
CSTE AECs among members of our epidemiology work group. This is not an "off the shelf" application and not being updated. I've provided this survey as a template should you want to use it to create your own survey. 

If using this application, you'll need to create your own connection with google sheets. Specifically, you'll need to:
1) obtain your own .secrets file with google sheets file and save in the .secrets folder, specify your credentials, and specify the file code name.
2) Modify the UI as needed.
3) If wanting to make this more production ready you'll need to address the div() statements
